## Chat to Compose Video
FFMPerative is your copilot for video editing workflows. Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) through an intuitive chat interface, now you can compose video edits in natural language to do things like:

* Change Speed, Resize, Crop, Flip, Reverse Video/GIF
* Speech-to-Text Transcription and Closed-Captions

FFMPerative is great at task compositition, just describe your changes like [these examples](https://remyxai.github.io/FFMPerative/).

## Setup 

### Requirements
* Python 3 
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org)

PyPI:
```
pip install ffmperative
```

Or pip install from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/remyxai/FFMPerative.git
cd FFMPerative && pip install .
```

`ffmperative` calls a remote service by default but can call a locally hosted model using the `--local` flag.
To use the remote option, set an environment variable with a huggingface token:

```
export HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
```

## Quickstart
To sample an image from a video clip, simply run FFMPerative from the command-line:

```bash
ffmperative do --prompt "sample the 5th frame from /path/to/video.mp4"
```

Similarly, it's simple to split a long video into short clips via scene detection:

```bash
ffmperative do --prompt "split the video '/path/to/my_video.mp4' by scene"
```

Or to add closed-captions with:

```bash
ffmperative do --prompt "merge subtitles 'captions.srt' with video 'video.mp4' calling it 'video_caps.mp4'"
```

## Features

### Python Usage
Simply import the library and pass your command as a string to `ffmp`.

```python
from ffmperative import ffmp

ffmp("sample the 5th frame from '/path/to/video.mp4'", local=True)
```

You can also use the command-line interface:
```bash
ffmperative do --p "sample the 5th frame from '/path/to/video.mp4'" --local
```

### Compose üéûÔ∏è 
Use the `compose` call to compose clips into an edited video. Use the optional `--prompt` flag to guide the composition by text prompt.
```bash
ffmperative compose --clips /path/to/video/dir --output /path/to/my_video.mp4 --prompt "Edit the video for social media" --local
```
